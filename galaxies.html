    <p class="intro">
        Zooming out far beyond the stars we see in the night sky, we find galaxiesâ€”immense collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, all bound together. Each galaxy is like a cosmic city, home to billions of stars and countless mysteries. Some galaxies are graceful spirals like the Milky Way, while others are chaotic or elliptical in shape. They've been around for billions of years, and they continue to grow and change through time, sometimes even colliding and merging with each other. Exploring galaxies helps us understand the vast structure and history of the universe

                <h2 id="introd">ðŸŒ€ What Are Galaxies?</h2>
                <p>Galaxies are huge systems in space made up of stars, gas, dust, dark matter, and other celestial objectsâ€”all bound together by gravity.
                   There are billions of galaxies in the universe, and they come in different shapes and sizes.
                   Galaxies can contain millions to trillions of stars, and they often exist in clusters or groups. Theyâ€™re basically the building blocks of the universe on a grand scale.

                <h4>1- Spiral Galaxies</h4>
                <p>
                    Shape: Flat, disk-like structure with a central bulge and spiral arms.<br>

                    Example: Milky Way, Andromeda.<br>
                    
                    Features: Lots of gas and dust; active star formation; contains both old and young stars.

                <h4>2- Elliptical Galaxies</h4>
                <p>
                    Shape: Round to elongated (elliptical); no spiral structure.<br>
                    Example: Messier 87.<br>
                    Features: Mostly old stars; little gas and dust; minimal star formation; ranges from small (dwarf ellipticals) to giant ellipticals

                    Shape: No defined shape.<br>

                    Example: Large Magellanic Cloud.<br>
                    
                    Features: Rich in gas and dust; lots of star formation; often result from galactic collisions or gravitational interactions

                        Galaxy collisions are some of the most dramatic and fascinating events in the universe. Contrary to what the term might suggest,
                        these collisions are not like car crashes â€” galaxies are made up mostly of empty space, so when they collide, the stars usually
                        pass by each other without direct contact. However, their massive gravitational fields interact strongly, pulling stars, gas, and dust into new structures,
                        and often triggering intense bursts of star formation. One of the most well-known upcoming collisions is between our own Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy,
                        which are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years. This cosmic event will reshape both galaxies into a larger, likely elliptical galaxy often referred to as "Milkomeda."
                        Despite the scale of this event, Earth is unlikely to be destroyed, though the night sky will change dramatically. Famous examples of ongoing galaxy collisions include the Antennae Galaxies,
                        known for their spectacular starburst regions, the Mice Galaxies with their long tidal tails, and NGC 6240, a chaotic system containing two supermassive black holes on the verge of merging.
                        Galaxy collisions play a vital role in the evolution of the universe, reshaping galaxies and influencing the birth of new stars
