    <p class="intro">When you look up at the night sky, those tiny twinkling dots are stars—some much larger and brighter than our Sun, and others already nearing the end of their lives. Stars have fascinated humans for thousands of years, inspiring stories, guiding travelers, and sparking scientific discovery. They're born deep in clouds of gas and dust and can live for millions to billions of years, shaping the universe with their light and energy. Understanding stars helps us learn more about the origins of planets—and even life itself.</p>

                    <h2>🌟 What Are Stars?</h2>
                    <p class="introduction">Stars are giant, glowing balls of hot gas, mostly made of hydrogen and helium. Deep in their cores, stars produce energy through a process called nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, releasing a massive amount of light and heat.

                    From Earth, stars look like tiny twinkling dots in the night sky, but they are actually huge — many are much larger and brighter than our Sun. The Sun itself is a star — just the closest one to us, which is why it looks so big and bright.
                    There are billions of stars in our galaxy, and each one has its own size, color, temperature, and life story.<br>
                     *Some live for billions of years, while others burn out quickly in dramatic explosions called supernovae. Every star you see is a cosmic light that's traveled across space, sometimes for thousands or even millions of years,
                    just to reach your eyes.</p>

                      <h2>🌟 Types Of Stars</h2>
                      <h4>Main sequence stars</h4>
                      <p>
                        These are the most common stars — including our Sun!<br>
                        They shineby burning hydrogen into helium.
                        <br>They can be small, medium, or massive, and their color depends on temperature (blue = hot, red = cool).
                      </p>
                      <div>
                        <img src="assests/sunny.jpg" />
                      </div>
                      <h4>1- Red Giants</h4>
                      <p>
                        A star becomes a red giant when it runs out of <br>
                        The outer layers expand, and the star glows red and cool.<br>
                        They're huge but not very dense
                      </p>
                      <div>
                        <img src="assests/red.avif" />
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <h4>2- Blue Giants & Super Giants</h4>
                    <p>
                        These are massive, super hot stars that burn very brightly <br>
                        They live fast and die young — often ending in supernova explosions.<br>
                        Example: Rigel in the Orion constellation
                    </p>

                        <img src="assests/blue.png" />
                      </div>
                    <h4>3- White Dwarfs</h4>
                    <p>
                        The leftover core of a star like the Sun, after it sheds its outer layers.<br>
                        Very small and dense — about the size of Earth but with the mass of the Sun!<br>
                        Doesn't burn fuel anymore, just slowly cools down
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="assests/WhiteDwarf.webp" />
                    </div>
                    <h4>4- Neutron Stars</h4>
                    <p>
                        Formed when a massive star explodes in a supernova.<br>
                        Super dense: one teaspoon of neutron star stuff would weigh billions of tons!<br>
                        Sometimes spin rapidly and emit beams of light — these are called pulsars
                    </p>
