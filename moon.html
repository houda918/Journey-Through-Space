    <p class="intro">"Have you ever looked up at the night sky and noticed that the moon doesn't always look the same? Sometimes it's a thin sliver,
        other times it's a perfect glowing circle. These changes are called moon phases, and they follow a regular cycle as the moon orbits the Earth.
        The shifting shapes we see are caused by the changing angles between the Earth, moon, and sun. Understanding the moon's phases not only connects us
        to ancient traditions of sky-watching but also reveals the fascinating dance between celestial bodies above us."</p>

                      <h2>Fist Quarter</h2>
                      <p> The Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that’s not really what you’re witnessing in the sky. You’re seeing just a slice of the entire Moon ― half of the illuminated half. A first quarter moon rises around noon and sets around midnight. It’s high in the sky in the evening and makes for excellent viewing.</p>

                      <p>This is as close as we come to seeing the Sun’s illumination of the entire day side of the Moon (so, technically, this would be the real half moon). The Moon is opposite the Sun, as viewed from Earth, revealing the Moon’s dayside. A full moon rises around sunset and sets around sunrise. The Moon will appear full for a couple of days before it moves into….</p>

                      <p>As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the opposite side of the Moon now reflects the Moon’s light. The lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moon’s orbit is simply carrying it out of view from our perspective. The Moon rises later and later each night.</p>
